# accelerate-mtcnn
	MTCNN Face Detection 
	This is a C++ version used Caffe
## 
half model shrink the orignal onet by half quantities of parameters with faster forward computing and similar results on fddb
you can try different thresholds and minsize value to  perform best on your own datasets

# Useage
- [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)
